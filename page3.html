    <center><h1>MERCEDES BENZ</h1></center> 
    <h3><p>The Mercedes-Benz Group origin is in an Agreement of Mutual Interest signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz & Cie. (founded in 1883 by Carl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded in 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach). Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged – becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) – and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of "Mercedes-Benz" on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG's directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named Daimler-Mercedes, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the Mercedes 35 hp. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.</p></h3>

    <h2>Mercedes-Benz Core Models</h2>
    <h3><p>Mercedes-Benz has five core models that are always a part of the naming nomenclature. These five core models are A, B, C, E, and S. Mercedes-Benz uses these core models internationally, therefore some letters do not apply to the United States market. Many of these core models apply to the United States market, such as C being the C-Class sedan, C-Class Coupe, and C-Class Cabriolet.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>The extra letters that are added on to core model letters on many models, such as the CLA and GLC also have meanings. Mercedes-Benz models such as the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Mercedes-Benz CLA have the letters CL added on. The CL means that the vehicle is a 4-door coupe, and therefore only applies to the four-door coupes of the Mercedes-Benz lineup.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>Also, models such as the Mercedes-Benz SL and Mercedes-Benz SLC have the letters SL in their naming, to distinguish them as a Roadster vehicle. These roadster vehicles are often two-seater vehicles that feature a hardtop convertible roof. The previous Mercedes-Benz SLK Roadster is now renamed the Mercedes-Benz SLC.</p></h3>

    <h3><p>Last but not least, our many models that feature the letters GL. These vehicles include the Mercedes-Benz GLS, Mercedes-Benz GLE, Mercedes-Benz GLC, and Mercedes-Benz GLA. The GL prefix is meant to be a nod to the famous signature Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV, which is the flagship SUV of the Mercedes-Benz SUV lineup. Therefore, any Mercedes-Benz vehicle with the letters GL will be considered an SUV. Many of the Mercedes-Benz SUVs that many people know and love have been affected by the new naming standards of Mercedes-Benz and have been renamed. These models include the Mercedes-Benz ML, Mercedes-Benz GL, and Mercedes-Benz GLK. The Mercedes-Benz ML is now the Mercedes-Benz GLE, the Mercedes-Benz GL is renamed the Mercedes-Benz GLS, and the Mercedes-Benz GLK is now the Mercedes-Benz GLC.</p></h3>
