    <center><h1>BMW</h1></center>
    <h3><p>The BMW name stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke. The company was incorporated into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916.</p>

    <p>Let’s face it: BMW model names can be confusing, especially with changes and updates in recent years. From ascending numbers to additions like xDrive and M models, it’s easy to get lost in the labyrinth of BMW’s naming conventions. Thankfully, BMW follows patterns throughout its lineup that are simple once you learn them. Here’s a quick guide for understanding BMW model names in 2023, so you can sound like a pro.</p>
    <P>BMW Series and Models Breakdown: There are currently 10 different groups in the BMW lineup, separated into numerical and letter distinctions.</P>
    <p>2 Series – a two-door coupe and convertible that is smallest in size and lowest in price</p>
    <p>3 Series – a four-door compact sedan available as a sports wagon (Touring) or slightly larger Gran Turismo</p>
    <p>4 Series – a compact two-door coupe also available as a convertible or as a four-door Gran Coupe </p>
    <p>5 Series – a quintessential midsize four-door sedan available in standard gas, plug-in hybrid, and high-performance options</p>
    <p>7 Series – a full-size four-door sedan available in a high-performance M sedan and an ALPINA sedan</p>
    <p>8 Series – a top luxury full-size modern coupe available as a convertible, a four-door Gran Coupe, or as M coupes.</p>
    <p>X Models – a series of larger SUVs and crossovers from the X1 to X7, with available M modele </p>
    <p>M Models – Versions of select BMM series and X models that offer higher performance (e.g. the X3 is also available as X3 M)</p>
    <p>BMW i Models – BMW’s electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, both a unique model and as hybrid options (like the 530e plug-in hybrid)</p>
    <p>What do the Numbers Mean Within BMW Models? You may have seen a 5 series sedan labeled as a 530i, 540i, or an M550i. In general, the larger the last two digits in the number, the more powerful the engine performs. For instance, a 540i will be more powerful than a 530i. While these numbers were originally linked to engine size, they now represent general power.</p>
    <p>What do the Letters Mean Within BMW Models? The letter at the end of each vehicle’s name represents the type of fuel used. An “i” signals a gas model, “d” for diesel vehicles, and “e” for plug-in hybrids. BMW’s electric i Models have an “i” before the numbers in the vehicle name. So, a 2023 BMW i4 is electric, while a BMW 330i is gas-powered.</p>
    <p>What do xDrive and sDrive Mean? xDrive is BMW’s all-wheel-drive system available in select models, while sDrive represents the standard 2-wheel drive system. xDrive will be clearly spelled out in the name of the specific vehicle. For example, if an X model comes with xDrive, it could be written as BMW X3 xDrive30i.

        At first glance, BMW model names may seem like a foreign language, but once you learn the patterns, understanding model naming conventions in 2023 is a piece of cake.</p></h3>
